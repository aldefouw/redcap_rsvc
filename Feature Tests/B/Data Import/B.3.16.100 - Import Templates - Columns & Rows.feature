Feature: User Interface: The system shall support the ability to download two versions of a data import template formatted as a CSV file, one to accommodate records in rows and one to accommodate records in columns.

As a REDCap end user
I want to see that Data import is functioning as expected

Scenario: B.3.16.100.100 data import template rows
#ATS requires two scenarios for assessing the row and column file
Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
And I create a new project named "B.3.16.100.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_3.16.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button 

#SETUP_PRODUCTION
When I click on the button labeled "Move project to production" 
And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box
Then I should see "Project status: Production"

#FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
##ACTION Data Import Template (with records in rows)
When I click on the link labeled "Data Import Tool"
Then I should see "Download your Data Import Template"

When I click on the link labeled "Download your Data Import Template (with records in rows)"
