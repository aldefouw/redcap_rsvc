Feature: User Interface: The system shall ignore survey identifier and timestamp fields on all data import spreadsheets and allow all other data to be imported.

As a REDCap end user
I want to see that Data import is functioning as expected

Scenario: B.3.16.600.100 Import ignores survey identifier and timestamp fields

#SETUP   
Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
And I create a new project named "B.3.16.600.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "B.3.16.600Project.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button 

#SETUP_PRODUCTION  
When I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"   
And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box 
And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box  
Then I should see "Project status:  Production"  
 
When I click on the link labeled "Data Import Tool"  
And I click on the button labeled "Choose File"  
And I upload the csv file labeled "B.3.16.600_DataImport.csv"  
And I click on the button labeled "Upload File"  
And I click on the button labeled "Import Data"  
Then I should see "Import Successful!" 
 
When I click the link labeled " Data Exports, Reports and Stats"   
And I click the button labeled " View Report"   
##VERIFY_DE  
Then I should see a table header and rows including the following values in the report data table: 
|record_id| Survey Identifier    |  Survey Timestamp    |ptname |
|         4      |                                  |                                       | My Name|
|         5      |                                  |                                       | Your Name|
|         6      |                                  |                                       | That Name|

#Manual: new records were imported and survey timestamp fields and identifier fields are ignored
