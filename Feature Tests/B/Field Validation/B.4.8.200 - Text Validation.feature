Feature: User Interface: The system shall support text validation for text field types: Date (Y-M-D) | Datetime (Y-M-D H:M) | Datetime w/seconds (Y-M-D H:M:S) |  Email  | Integer | Numbers | Number (1 decimal place - comma as decimal) | Time (HH:MM)  | Time (MM:SS) | Time (HH:MM:SS)

As a REDCap end user
I want to see that Field validation is functioning as expected

Scenario: B.4.8.200.100 Field validation type

#SETUP 
Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin" 
And I create a new project named "B.4.8.200.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_4.8.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button 
When I click on the link labeled "My Projects" 
And I click on the link labeled "B.4.8.200.100" 

#SETUP _PRODUCTION 
When I click on the link labeled "Project Setup" 
And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production" 
And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box 
And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status 
Then I should see "Project status: Production" 

##VERIFY_CODEBOOK
When I click on the link labeled "Codebook" 
Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the Data Dictionary Codebook data table:  
| Variable / Field Name|   Field Label  |      Field Attributes      | 
|     [date_ymd]              |   date YMD   |      text (date_ymd, Min: 2023-08-01, Max: 2023-08-31) |
