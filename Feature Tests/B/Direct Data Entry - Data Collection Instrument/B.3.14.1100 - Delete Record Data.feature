Feature: Deleting Data: The system shall allow users to delete all data in an event for a given record.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that delete all data is functioning as expected

        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
        #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
        And I create a new project named "B.3.14.1100.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_3.14.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
