Feature: User Interface: The system shall support the ability to limit access to the Record Locking Customization module through user rights.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Record locking and E-signatures is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.2.19.900.100 Enable user rights for Record Locking Customization module
        #ATS prerequisite: Normal users cannot move projects to production by default - let's adjust that before we proceed.
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
        And I click on the link labeled "User Settings"
        Then I should see "System-level User Settings"
        Given I select "Yes, normal users can move projects to production" on the dropdown field labeled "Allow normal users to move projects to production?"
        When I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
        And I see "Your system configuration values have now been changed!"
        Then I logout

        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
        And I create a new project named "C.2.19.900.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #USER_RIGHTS
        When I click on the link labeled "User Rights"
        And I click on the link labeled "Test User1"
        And I click on the button labeled "Edit user privileges" on the tooltip
        Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "Editing existing user"

        Given I check the User Right named "Record Locking Customization"
        And I select the User Right named "Lock/Unlock Records" and choose "Locking / Unlocking with E-signature authority"
        Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "NOTICE"
        And I click on the button labeled "Close" in the dialog box

        Given I check the User Right named "Lock/Unlock *Entire* Records (record level)"
        When I save changes within the context of User Rights
        Then I should see 'User "test_user1" was successfully edited'

        ##VERIFY_LOG
        When I click on the link labeled "Logging"
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the logging table:

            | test_user1 | Update user test_user1 | user = 'test_user1'                     |
