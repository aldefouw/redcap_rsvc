Feature: User Interface: The system shall support the ability to run custom data quality rules real time.

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Data Quality Module is functioning as expected

  Scenario: C.4.18.1000.100 Real-time rule execution

        #SETUP
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
    And I create a new project named "C.4.18.1000.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_418.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION
    When I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
    And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
    And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
    And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box
    Then I should see "Project status: Production"

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION: Rule Creation
    When I click on the link labeled "Data Quality"
    Then I should see "Data Quality Rules"

    When I enter "Integer" for the field labeled "Rule Name"
    And I enter "[integer]<>'1999'" for the field labeled "Logic Editor"
    And I click on the button labeled "Update & Close Editor" in the dialog box
    And I select the checkbox labeled "Execute in real time on data entry forms"
    And I click on the button labeled "Add"
    Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the Data Quality Rules table:
      | Rule # | Rule Name | Rule Logic (Show discrepancy only if...) | Real-time execution |
      | 3      | Integer   | [integer]<>'1999'                        | Enabled             |
