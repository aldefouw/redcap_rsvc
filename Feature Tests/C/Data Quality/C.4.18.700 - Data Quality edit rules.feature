Feature: User Interface: The system shall support editing of user defined rules.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data Quality Module is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.4.18.700.100 Edit rule

        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
        #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
        And I create a new project named "C.4.18.700.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project418.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION
        When I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
        And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box

        #USER_RIGHTS
        When I click on the link labeled "User Rights"
        And I click on the link labeled "Test_User1"
        And I click on the button labeled "Edit User Privileges"
        And I verify the checkbox labeled "Create & edit rules" for the field labeled "Data Quality" is selected
        And I verify the checkbox labeled "Execute rules" for the field labeled "Data Quality" is selected
        And I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
        Then I should see "User "test_user1" was successfully edited"

        #FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENT
        ##ACTION: Manual rule add
        When I click on the link labeled "Data Quality"
        Then I should see "Data Quality Rules"

        When I enter "Integer" for the field labeled "Rule Name"
        And I enter "[integer]='1'" for the field labeled "Logic Editor"
        And I click on the button labeled "Update & Close Editor" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "Add"
        ##VERIFY
        Then I should see a table header and rows including the following values in the Data Quality Rules table:
            | Rule # | Rule Name | Rule Logic (Show discrepancy only if...) |
            | 3      | Integer   | [integer]='1'                            |

        ##ACTION executing rule
        When I click on the button labeled "All" in the Data Quality Rules controller box
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the data quality report table:
